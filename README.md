# Image Generation: Diffusion Models & ComfyUI

This repository includes two educational PDF documents focused on image generation using modern diffusion models:

1. **Diffusion Models – A Theoretical Introduction**  
   A concise yet thorough course that covers the fundamentals of diffusion models, including forward/reverse processes, denoising, and model training.

2. **Hands-On with ComfyUI – Practical Lab**  
   A guided lab session designed to explore image generation using the ComfyUI interface. It walks through real-world workflows, including prompt design, model selection, and visual experimentation.

These resources aim to bridge theory and practice, and are suited for learners, hobbyists, and AI practitioners alike.
